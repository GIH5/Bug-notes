|---Use-After-Free---|
|
|---Memory needs to be distributed to things like varibles, functions and other things and needs to deallocated once not needed
|
|---Stack memory --> static allocation
|
|---Heap memory --> dynamic allocation / developer doing it manually
|
|---Functions ---|
.malloc          |
.free            |        <-- memory allocations and deallocations
.new             |
.delete          |
|----------------|
|
|---Use after free is a bug where the binary continues to use memory after its been freed or deallocated and can lead into eccentric behavior, vulnerbilties or crash the program
